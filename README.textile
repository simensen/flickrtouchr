A Python script to grab all your photos from flickr and dump them into a directory, organized into folders by set name. The filenames are named based on the combo of the photo's original date-taken and the Flickr photo ID.

Changes include tweaks to name files based on their date-taken meta-data so that the files sort chronologically and improvements in handling UTF8 file and photoset names.

Run it like this:

<pre>
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder
python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

You'll be prompted to authorize with Flickr, and then the magic happens.
